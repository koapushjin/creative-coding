  <p>Suzuki, Kido, and the Emperor realized the day would end with either an acceptance of the American terms or a military coup. The Emperor met with the most senior Army and Navy officers. While several spoke in favor of fighting on, Field Marshal Shunroku Hata did not. As commander of the Second General Army, the headquarters of which had been in Hiroshima, Hata commanded all the troops defending southern Japan—the troops preparing to fight the "decisive battle". Hata said he had no confidence in defeating the invasion and did </p>

<br><br>
<p id="italic"> I have listened carefully to each of the arguments presented in opposition to the view that Japan should accept the Allied reply as it stands and without further clarification or modification, but my own thoughts have not undergone any change. ... In order that the people may know my decision, I request you to prepare at once an imperial rescript so that I may broadcast to the nation. Finally, I call upon each and every one of you to exert himself to the utmost so that we may meet the trying days which lie ahead.

<p>A microwave oven cooks or heats food by dielectric heating. Cooking food with microwaves was discovered by Percy Spencer, while building magnetrons for radar sets at Raytheon. Spencer was working on an active radar set when he noticed a strange sensation and saw that a peanut candy bar he had in his pocket started to melt. Although he was not the first to notice this phenomenon, as the holder of 120 patents, Spencer was no stranger to discovery and experiment and realized what was  	      	<!-- <figure class="figure">

            <p>It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.</p>
            <p>Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels.  I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples.  And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.</p> -->

          <p>The radar had melted his candy bar with microwaves. The first food to be deliberately cooked with microwaves was popcorn, and the second was an egg. The radar had melted his candy bar with microwaves.</p>

            <p>This past week, many places around the world received an identical encryption code. Some appeared in the mailbox, some in the straw. One student from Beijing, China, even claimed to have seen the letter come out of the air suddenly and fall on his desk. Whether this was a frivolous prank or a premeditated political or racial act remains to be seen. We will follow up If there is any new progress. The code is posted on the right.</p>
